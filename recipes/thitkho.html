    <h1>Thit Kho (Caramelized Pork Belly)</h1>
    <img src="../images/thitkho.png" alt="Thit Kho">

    <h1>Description:</h1>
    <p>Thit kho tau (or thit kho for short) is a very popular dish in Vietnamese households for everyday eating, but it's also traditionally served during Táº¿t, the Vietnamese Lunar New Year. The longer you cook the pork belly, the more tender it becomes. If you make this dish ahead of time, the fat will congeal on the surface, making it easier to remove and a little healthier! This also allows the flavors to meld a little more. Serve with rice.</p>

    <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds pork belly, trimmed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>5 shallots, sliced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>13 fluid ounces coconut water</li>
        <li>6 hard-boiled eggs, peeled</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice pork belly into 1-inch pieces layered with skin, fat, and meat.</li>
        <li>Heat sugar in a large wok or pot over medium heat until it melts and caramelizes into a light brown syrup, about 5 minutes. Add pork and increase the heat to high. Cook and stir to render some of the pork fat, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir shallots and garlic into the wok. Add fish sauce and black pepper; stir until pork is evenly coated. Pour in coconut water and bring to a boil. Add hard-boiled eggs and reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer, checking occasionally and adding a little water if the liquid evaporates too much, until pork is tender, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and let stand for about 10 minutes. Skim fat from the surface of the dish.</li>
    </ol>
